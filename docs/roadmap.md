## Overview

This is our public roadmap that outlines the high level direction we are working towards, namely [Themes](#themes). We update this document when our priorities change: security and stability is our top priority.

[See our latest list of activities ¬ª](https://github.com/orgs/awslabs/projects/56/views/1?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc){target="_blank"}

## Themes

Themes are key activities maintainers are focusing on, besides bug reports. These are updated periodically and you can find the latest [under Epics in our public board](https://github.com/orgs/awslabs/projects/51/views/11?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc){target="_blank"}.

### Revamp roadmap

We are beta testing the [new GitHub Projects Beta](https://github.com/orgs/awslabs/projects/56/views/1?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc){target="_blank"} to provide more visibility on our current activities. This also includes new GitHub Issue Forms Beta to streamline feature requests, bug reports, RFCs, etc., including a new mechanism to add external links like `Ask a Question`.

Once complete, we will repurpose our [central roadmap repository](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-roadmap){target="_blank"} to provide a landing page for all Powertools languages, including an experiment to better highlight feature parity across them.

## Disclaimer

The AWS Lambda Powertools team values feedback and guidance from its community of users, although final decisions on inclusion into the project will be made by AWS.

We determine the high-level direction for our open roadmap based on customer feedback and popularity (üëçüèΩ and comments), security and operational impacts, and business value. Where features don‚Äôt meet our goals and longer-term strategy, we will communicate that clearly and openly as quickly as possible with an explanation of why the decision was made.

## FAQs

**Q: Why did you build this?**

A: We know that our customers are making decisions and plans based on what we are developing, and we want to provide our customers the insights they need to plan.

**Q: Why are there no dates on your roadmap?**

A: Because job zero is security and operational stability, we can't provide specific target dates for features. The roadmap is subject to change at any time, and roadmap issues in this repository do not guarantee a feature will be launched as proposed.

**Q: How can I provide feedback or ask for more information?**

A: For existing features, you can directly comment on issues. For anything else, please open an issue.
