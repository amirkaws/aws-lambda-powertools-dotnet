## Tenets

* **AWS Lambda only** – We optimise for AWS Lambda function environments and supported runtimes only. Utilities might work with web frameworks and non-Lambda environments, though they are not officially supported.
* **Eases the adoption of best practices** – The main priority of the utilities is to facilitate best practices adoption, as defined in the AWS Well-Architected Serverless Lens; all other functionality is optional.
* **Keep it lean** – Additional dependencies are carefully considered for security and ease of maintenance, and prevent negatively impacting startup time.
* **We strive for backwards compatibility** – New features and changes should keep backwards compatibility. If a breaking change cannot be avoided, the deprecation and migration process should be clearly defined.
* **We work backwards from the community** – We aim to strike a balance of what would work best for 80% of customers. Emerging practices are considered and discussed via Requests for Comment (RFCs)
* **Idiomatic** – Utilities follow programming language idioms and language-specific best practices.

_`*` Core utilities are Tracer, Logger and Metrics. Optional utilities may vary across languages._
